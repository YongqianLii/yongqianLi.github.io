    <h2>Profile</h2>
    <p>
      As a logically rigorous and innovation-driven researcher, I pursued a PhD in the field of infertility at the UCLouvain University School of Medicine from January 2023 to March 2025 (second-year), during which I developed solid experimental techniques and data analysis skills. My core competencies include:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Experimental Techniques:</strong> Proficient in PCR, HE staining, immunohistochemistry, immunofluorescence, and TUNEL assays.</li>
      <li><strong>Data Analysis:</strong> Skilled in using R and Python for data processing, visualization, and bioinformatics analysis.</li>
      <li><strong>Animal Handling:</strong> Certified in laboratory animal operations in Belgium, with expertise in aseptic techniques and general anesthesia.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      From 2020 to 2022, I enhanced my practical skills in R and Python while working at Shanghai Qianshuo Bio, where I also completed a comprehensive course in single-cell omics analysis to further strengthen my bioinformatics abilities.
    </p>
    <p>
      Between 2016 and 2019, I served as a clinical assistant for IVF patients at Shanghai University of Traditional Chinese Medicine and Tongji University, gaining valuable clinical experience and participating in two rat-related research projects. In one project that I led, I successfully secured a university innovation fund and managed over one hundred laboratory animals, performing general anesthesia, sterile surgical procedures, as well as experiments involving hCG-induced ovulation, egg collection, and parthenogenetic activation.
    </p>
    <p>
      Given that my current research project shows significant discrepancies with human data from over 150 medical centers and lacks dedicated funding, I am actively seeking new PhD opportunities. I am eager to contribute my expertise in a dynamic and growth-oriented environment that values innovative research and translational clinical applications.
